the important programs for this Lab 5 are :

main.py
object_structure.py
merge_sort_on_list_of_object.py
filling_items_using_fracitonal_knapsack.py

In this implementation of knapsack : we assume that the profits and
weights of each entity is unique
if it is not unique then this program may not give the most optimised
 result (depends on the order in which the items are inputted to the
 program), although it will be close to the actual value

Eg :
profit : 120 , weight : 20
profit : 120 , weight : 24

in this case if the approach 1 of putting max profit element in bag
1st is applied then the one which is inputted 1st to the program will be
considered

thus while using approach 1 we are not trying to optimise for minimum weight for the same profit
this is the limitation of this program
